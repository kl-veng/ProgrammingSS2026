# ProgrammingSS2026
The repository of the course "Introduction to Programming" at UNI Graz.

- summer semester 25/26

  Course adapted from:  https://github.com/lucijakrusic/IP23 by Lucija Krusic, originally adapted from https://github.com/gvasold/gdp by Gunter Vasold.

It will contain all Jupyter Notebooks and example data that we will use during the course. All notebooks will be in English.

## Usage

To use the notebooks make sure you have installed:
* Python version 3. 
* Jupyter. Install it via pip or conda (`pip install --user jupyter` or `conda install jupyter` if you use Conda/Anaconda)
* I suggest to also install jupyterlab, which is a more modern version of `jupyter notebook` (which was installed automatically with `jupyter`): 
  `pip install --user jupyterlab` or `conda install jupyterlab`.

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kl-veng/ProgrammingSS2026.git
```

Then change into `programming1WS22` directory and start the Jupyter server:

```bash
cd ProgrammingSS2026
```

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or, if you have installed jupyterlab:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```

This will bring up your browser and will show you the contents of the `ProgrammingSS2026` directory.
